Being a developer I thought; I'm crap at doing presentationsâ€¦ Why not built it
in Storybook? ðŸ¤¯

[Let's look briefly how it looks](http://localhost:6006/)

Breakpoints
======================
In web development, breakpoints are specific screen sizes where the layout and design of a website are optimized for different devices. 
They are used in responsive web design to ensure that the website adapts and displays correctly on various screens, like desktops, tablets, 
and mobile phones. Breakpoints allow developers to make adjustments to the design and layout depending on the screen size, ensuring an 
optimal user experience across devices.

Our breakpoints

<ul>
{breakpoints.map((bp) => (
  <li>{bp}</li>
))}

Setup a Storybook with framework of your choosing. Have a look at [Stone Valley Design System](https://www.figma.com/file/UTmWQEoZu5Z5tZkDOCXzr4/Stone-Valley-Design-System?node-id=10%3A170&mode=dev) 
and start implementing its components and/or Design Tokens. 

Pick a component ex. Button, and start implementing it as stories.
