===============
This contains documentation page might contain some more information that might be interesting for 
a consumer of this component.

You can obviously also have longer code examples.

const SomeComponent = () => {
  const [state, setState] = useState("");
  return (
    <Box>
      <DocsLink type="chromatic" />
    </Box>
  )
}
```
